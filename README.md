# discord_bot
Hey all!
This is the code for my bot Eclipsebot on discord. I have removed the token and most of the inventory files - 
If you want to provide your own bot token, you can make a file in the main directory called "TOKEN.txt".
The code will read the first line from that file and use it as the token.
